odd_even_game.py 
a simple game written for the Micro:bit in Micropython.
tests a child's ability to identify odd or even numbers.

portable_data_logger.py
written for the Micro:bit in Micropython
uses built in compass and temperature sensors to collect direction and temp
every 10 seconds and writes that data to a CSV file stored locally

micro:bit_as_switch.py
written for the Micro:bit in Micropython
uses the write.digital function of the controller to use the Micro:bit as an external 
switch to safely shutdown a Raspberry Pi 3

safe_shutdown_pi.py
written for the Raspberry Pi 3 b+ using Python
Creates a script for safely shutting down a Raspberry Pi by using a Micro:bit
as an external off button. Designed to work with a micro:bit flashed with 
micro:bit_as_switch.py

rfid_reader_pyth2.py 
written for python 2 to take advantage of the PN532 and SPI libraries developed by 
Adafruit. The library is available at GitHub: 
https://github.com/john-decker/Adafruit_Python_PN532
It also forked to my repository under Adafruit_Python_PN532
This code was written for the pi to operate as a headless rfid reader and playback
machine.
